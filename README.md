Generates helpful reports from third and newest iteration of teacher credentialing dataset

Uses files "SAW2710193 - Employees w Computer Science Credentials - 2017-02-23.xlsx" obtained from HR and "cs4all-schools.csv"
which is a list I made of all cs4all schools that contains, for each school, its short name, long name, school code, and the name used
for it in the "Cohorts 1-3 rolodex" google doc. I can share this list upon request.
